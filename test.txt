Humans are expressive beings. This project was developed using deep learning concepts and it  can detect the pose you make in front of the camera. Several methods for predicting Human Pose Estimation have been proposed. These algorithms frequently start by identifying the component parts, then understand the connections between them to estimate the pose. Activity Recognition, Motion Capture and Augmented Reality, Training Robots, and Motion Tracking for Consoles in the game industry are just a few of the real-world applications of knowing a personâ€™s orientation.
